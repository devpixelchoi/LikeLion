# Whiat is NOTAM
 * A NOTAM is a notice containing information that is essential to
   personnel concerned with flight operations but that is not
   known far enough in advance to be publicized by other means.
   NOTAMs concern the establishment, condition, or change of any
   component (facility, service, procedure, or hazard) in the NAS.
   They must state the abnormal status of a component of the NAS(not the normal status).
